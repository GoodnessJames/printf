## Description of each Task in the Project

### Task 0

In this task, the _printf function produces output according to a format.

- Function Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
- Return Value: Upon SUCCESS, the _print function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings). Upon FAILURE (ie if an output error is encountered), the function returns -1.
- Conversion Specifiers: The conversion specifier is usually introduced by the character "%", and this character specifies the type of conversion to be applied. For this task, the function handles the following conversion specifiers:
	- c
	- s
	- %
**Exemptions:** The following are exempted and are not required for this task
- Buffer handling of the C library printf function
- Field width
- Precision
- Length modifiers

### Task 1

- d
- i

**Exemptions:** The following are exempted and are not required for this task
